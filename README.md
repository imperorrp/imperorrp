# <<(`Hello World!`)>>

I'm Ratish. I specialize in full stack and applied AI/ML software engineering and development. In the past, I've done freelance work building bots for NFT/Web3 orgs, built some personal projects, and contributed open source code as part of GSoC 2024. 

**Tech Stack**: 
- Languages: ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white), ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=black)
- Frameworks: ![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-005571?style=flat&logo=fastapi), ![Poetry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Poetry-%233B82F6.svg?style=flate&logo=poetry&logoColor=0B3D8D), ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?style=flat&logo=node.js&logoColor=white), ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=black), ![Astro](https://img.shields.io/badge/astro-%232C2052.svg?style=flate&logo=astro&logoColor=white), ![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next-black?style=flat&logo=next.js&logoColor=white), ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=flat&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

**Open Source Contributions**:
- Google Summer of Code 2024: [I worked on Arviz](https://github.com/imperorrp/gsoc-2024) - a Python package and project for exploratory analysis of Bayesian (probabilistic programming) models. More details on [this blog post](https://blog.ratishpanda.me/blog/gsoc-journey/)

**Some Works/Projects**: 

- [Crustdata API Support Bot](https://crustdata-chatbot-ratish.vercel.app/) - ([Repo](https://github.com/imperorrp/crustdata-support-chatbot-ai)): A Next.js + Vercel AI SDK based API chat support agent web app. Ask any questions about Crustdata's API. Uses RAG (with Crustdata API documentation) with a Supabase vector database to answer questions grounded on relevant API endpoint docs. Also has an authentication system and stores past chat histories for logged in users in a Vercel Postgresql database.
  
- [BOPE-GPT](https://bope-gpt.vercel.app/) - ([Repo](https://github.com/imperorrp/BOPE-GPT)): A Next.js+ FastAPI based web app and dashboard to orchestrate and perform the BOPE process (Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration) for multi objective optimization tasks. A prompted large language model is used as a "preference selector" and pareto front + gaussian process visualizations can be viewed. Uses MongoDB, Pytorch, Cohere API, and Plotly. BOPE is a technique introduced in a 2022 paper by researchers at Meta and Cornell University and some work done automating one of this technique's steps with an LLM in a 2024 hackathon I was part of was extended to produce this.

-	[Poiesis Ex Machina](https://poiesis-ex-machina.vercel.app) - ([Repo](https://github.com/imperorrp/poiesis-ex-machina)): Astro + React + Svelte serverless AI poetry generator with a cyberpunk/tech-noir aesthetic- a play on the concept of AI as humanity's "collective unconscious". Enter a prompt, pick an archetype (Eristics, Jungian, Dungeons and Dragons) and generate relevant poetry and art. Uses Together.ai to run image and text-to-image generation models. 

- Web3 + Custom Bots - ([Monorepo](https://github.com/imperorrp/UsefulBots)) : Monorepo portfolio of old bots I made for freelance clients. Built with Python and Javascript and several 3rd party APIs and API wrappers, for Discord, Twitter, Telegram.
