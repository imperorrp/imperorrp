# <<(`Hello World`)>>

I'm Ratish. This is a WIP Github README but I'm into fullstack development and bots and some applied ML and you can see some stuff I've worked on here on my profile. 

**Learning More About/Want to Know More About**: AI-augmented coding patterns and all (productivity enhancements here seem potentially so massive), the auxiliary Devops-y tech productionized apps need (CI/CD, containerization, queues and in memory caches, cloud provider tools for scaling, sharding- that sort of stuff)- realized I don't know much about these yet recently but should! 

**Tech Stack**: (so far)
- Languages: ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white), ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=black)
