# <<(`Hello World!`)>>

I'm Ratish. Welcome to my Github. I'm currently focusing on fullstack and applied AI/ML software engineering and development. In the past, I've done freelance work building bots for the NFT/Web3 community, and I also did some open source work on a Python package (ArviZ) recently for GSoC 2024. I plan on contributing to more open source and collaborative projects in the future as well, particularly impactful and interesting ones working in and around AI, the fundamental sciences, and Web3. 

**Currently Learning More About/Want to Know More About**: 
- AI-augmented coding patterns and methodology- including working effectively with AI agents (productivity enhancements here are potentially so massive, and it likely will become the norm in the next few years)
- ML/AI-engineering techniques and best practices- actually using AI/ML for features in fullstack apps, LLM usage techniques like fine-tuning, RAG, prompt-chaining, MoE, etc. Making full use of these kinds of emerging intelligence wherever possible and advantageous. 
- The auxiliary Devops-y tech productionized apps need (CI/CD, containerization, queues and in memory caches, cloud provider tools for scaling, database sharding, the intricacies of a backend web server- that sort of stuff). These are of course fundamental software engineering concepts, especially for anything pushed to production- necessary to scale products smoothly. 

**Tech Stack**: (so far)
- Languages: ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white), ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=black)
- Frameworks: ![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-005571?style=flat&logo=fastapi), ![Poetry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Poetry-%233B82F6.svg?style=flate&logo=poetry&logoColor=0B3D8D), ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?style=flat&logo=node.js&logoColor=white), ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=black), ![Astro](https://img.shields.io/badge/astro-%232C2052.svg?style=flate&logo=astro&logoColor=white), ![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next-black?style=flat&logo=next.js&logoColor=white), ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=flat&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)
