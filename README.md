# <<(`Hello World`)>>

I'm Ratish. I'm into fullstack development, bots and some applied ML and you can see some of the things I've worked on before here on my profile. Also recently made my first major open source contributions as part of GSoC 2024, for Arviz, a Python package for visualizing Bayesian models. 

**Currently Learning More About/Want to Know More About**: 
- AI-augmented coding patterns and all (productivity enhancements here seem potentially so massive)
- The auxiliary Devops-y tech productionized apps need (CI/CD, containerization, queues and in memory caches, cloud provider tools for scaling, sharding- that sort of stuff)- realized I don't know much about these yet recently but should! 

**Tech Stack**: (so far)
- Languages: ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white), ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=black)
